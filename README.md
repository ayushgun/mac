# Ayush's Dotfiles ðŸ”§

This repository is a collection of highly opinionated dotfiles customized exclusively to my liking. None of these configutations are meant to be generalized; use anything you want, but at your own risk.

# Sections

- `zsh`: my zsh profile, prompt, and config
- `vscode`: vscode settings and extensions

# Fonts

You should install the `iM Writer Mono` nerd font prior to using these dotfiles. Thanks to [NerdFonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads), you can find a free download [here](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/releases/download/v2.2.2/iA-Writer.zip).
