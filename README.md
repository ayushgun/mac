# Ayush's Dotfiles ðŸ”§

This repository is a collection of highly opinionated dotfiles customized exclusively to my liking. None of these configutations are meant to be generalized; use anything you want, but at your own risk.

# Sections

- `zsh`: my zsh profile, prompt, and config
- `vsc`: vscode settings

# Fonts

You should install the `JetBrains Mono` (nerd) font prior to using these dotfiles.
